# Steam Tracker

`tracker.py` is a precise Steam profile monitoring tool designed for OSINT enthusiasts, researchers, and gamers. Using the official Steam Web API, it tracks and logs real-time changes in user status, game activity, and profile details such as nickname, real name, country, avatar, and profile URL. Outputs are color-coded and timestamped, with persistent logs saved to `steam_status_log.txt`. Ideal for digital footprint analysis, user behavior tracking, and investigative research.

## Features

- Tracks Steam user status changes (online, offline, busy, away, etc.)
- Detects game start/stop events with timestamps and play duration
- Monitors profile updates: nickname, real name, country, profile URL, avatar changes
- Color-coded console output for easy reading
- Logs all events to a persistent log file
- Resolves custom Steam vanity URLs to SteamID64
- Runs in terminal, disables input echo for cleaner UX
- Simple setup, runs continuously until interrupted
